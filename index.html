                    <summary>Introducing Todogether: Your Smart Team Assistant</summary>
                    <p>
                        Todogether is a collaborative task management tool. It allows teams to assign, confirm, and track tasks efficiently. Todogether is more than just a task manager‚Äîit's a collaborative tool designed to ensure team efficiency. 
                        Whether you're managing a startup, coordinating a school project, or organizing a community event, Todogether 
                        helps you assign, track, and confirm tasks effortlessly.

                    <summary>Task Confirmation: Ensuring Accountability</summary>
                    <p>
                        When you're assigned a task, you must "Accept" it to confirm that you've seen it. If you don't, the system will remind you.
                        Imagine you're leading a marketing team, and you assign a task to create a campaign brief.  
                        Instead of wondering whether your teammate has seen the task, Todogether requires them to **accept** it first.  
                        If they forget, the system sends reminders, ensuring no task is overlooked.

                    <summary>Never Miss a Task: Smart Reminders & Automated Calls</summary>
                    <p>
                        Unaccepted tasks trigger automated reminders. If you don't confirm within the set time, Todogether will send notifications and, if necessary, trigger an automated call.
                        Let's say you assign a task to a designer, but they haven't accepted it within the given timeframe.  
                        Todogether will first send notifications, then escalate to an automated call if needed‚Äîjust like a real project manager following up!

                        Todogether analyzes your schedule and suggests the best time to complete tasks based on difficulty and availability.
                        If you‚Äôre juggling multiple deadlines, Todogether helps by syncing with your calendar.  
                        Based on your schedule and task urgency, it suggests the **best time** to complete each task‚Äîso you're never overloaded.
